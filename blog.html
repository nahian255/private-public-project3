            <h3>Question-1</h3>
            <p>what is the difference between local storage and session storage?</p>
            <p>sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't
                expire,
                data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a
                particular
                tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.</p>

            <h3>Question-2</h3>
            <p>what is the difference between local scope and global scope?</p>
            <p>Global scope variables can use within the program anyware. Global variables are declaring outside any
                functions. Local scope variable value is only for that particular scope (function). Local variables are
                declaring inside that particular function</p>
